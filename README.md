# Diner-Dash-Like-Game

The Game was developed using Java Swing with heavy use of Object oriented programming. 

## Description of the Game:

The player is the waiter/waitress of a restaurant and is given the task of taking orders from customers, giving them to the kitchen and then picking those orders from the kitchen after they are completed to give to the customers 

Each customer has a fixed time in which they expect the food to be bought to their table, depending on how long it takes for the waiter/waitress to get their food, the player is given points. 
After some time the customer can get angry and leave in which case the player loses points 

The restaurant has an indefinite stream of customers so the player can play for as long as they want.

## Other features include 

- Leaderboard : How the player has fared against other players on the PC
